Context Engineering Module

This module provides context engineering infrastructure for agents,
formalizing context as a graph of connections to enable meaningful
agent understanding and memory.

Context engineering layers:
- Prompting: Natural-language programming for agent goals
- Memory: RAG with vector databases for context retrieval
- Tools: MCP servers for consistent tool access
- Graphs: Knowledge graphs for formalized context as connections
