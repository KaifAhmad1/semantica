Hybrid Retriever for GraphRAG

Combines vector search speed with knowledge graph precision
for 30% accuracy improvements over vector-only RAG.
"""

# TODO: Implement hybrid retriever
# - Vector similarity search
# - Knowledge graph traversal from seed entities
# - Result fusion strategies (RRF, weighted, etc.)
# - Graph expansion from vector results
# - Context enrichment with relationships
# - Performance optimization for hybrid queries
